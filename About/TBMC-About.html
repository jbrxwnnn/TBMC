    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Hello everyone - my name is Jake and it is my pleasure to welcome you to The Bearded Man Cave!</p>

        <p>I created The Bearded Man Cave back in 2017 when I moved into my flat with my partner. This was the first
            time that I ever thought about content creation. I started small with a separate Instagram account and began
            posting gaming related photos every now and then (both video and tabletop).</p>

        <p>Flash-forward 2-years and we’re at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. During this time I was working
            loads
            and needed something more to unwind - this is when I started live streaming. I started out trying to mix up
            my
            content, but I ended up settling on pushing towards FIFA (I was playing a lot anyway so might as well carry
            on!)
        </p>

        <p>Life started to open back up and then streaming became rarer and rarer. Unfortunately, streaming isn’t
            something
            I’ve been able to put much effort into mid-2021 onwards, but watch this space for more in the future! Until
            then, you can jump onto the Clips page to see some of my highlights!</p>

        <p>I’m now aspiring to change careers and move into Software/Web Development. This is a <strong>BIG</strong>
            change
            of pace from
            what I currently do so I am having to divide my focus into pursuing a better future for myself. This process
            is
            exactly where this website has come from. This will be one of my first - and hopefully many - projects
            utilising
            skills that I have picked up from the courses I am undertaking. Any tips, tricks or feedback will be very
            welcome and be sure to check out my Blog page and GitHub profile to have a deeper look into what I’m doing!
